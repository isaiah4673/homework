        <h2> The Problem with Homework</h2>
        <p>Students today are overwhelmed with the amount of homework they receive, and it's affecting their well-being. Homework is meant to improve learning, but instead, it often causes stress and takes up valuable time that could be spent on extracurricular activities, family, or personal interests. Research even suggests that too much homework can be unhealthy for students and may not significantly improve their grades.</p>

        <h2> The Stress Homework Creates</h2>
        <p>As a student, I have experienced how stressful excessive homework can be. While teachers assign it to boost learning, too much of it leads to unnecessary anxiety. According to a Stanford University study, 56% of students say homework is their biggest source of stress—more than tests or the pressure to get good grades. Instead of helping students, homework often feels like an overwhelming burden. If schools adjusted their approach to homework, students could focus more on actually understanding the material rather than just completing assignments under pressure.</p>

        <h2> Homework Leaves No Free Time</h2>
        <p>Another major issue is how much time homework takes. Many students participate in extracurricular activities like sports, clubs, or music, making it difficult to balance their schedules. A study by arhsarbinger.com found that between 78% and 89% of students participate in extracurriculars, with 18% involved in after-school programs. With so much of their day already occupied, students barely have time for homework, which adds to their stress and takes away from important family time and personal interests.</p>

        <h2> Why Homework Needs to Be Reformed</h2>
        <p>This issue doesn’t just affect students—it affects parents too. Parents want their children to do well in school, but they also worry about their mental and physical health. Excessive homework can cause students to become exhausted, anxious, and even burned out. If schools reconsidered their approach to homework, students would not only perform better in class but also have time to develop other important life skills.</p>

        <h2> A Better Homework Strategy</h2>
        <p>Rather than eliminating homework altogether, schools should focus on assigning reasonable amounts of work that actually benefit students. Research suggests that moderate, well-structured homework improves academic performance, but excessive assignments lead to diminishing returns. One possible solution is the “flipped classroom” model, where students learn new material in school and complete brief review assignments at home. Another option is for teachers to set aside time during the school day for students to complete short, focused worksheets, reducing the need for excessive homework. This would allow students to have a healthier balance between schoolwork and personal time.</p>
